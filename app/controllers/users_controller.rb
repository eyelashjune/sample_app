  	#Here weâ€™ve used params to retrieve the user id. When we make the appropriate request to the Users controller, params[:id] will be the user id 1
  	#Technically, params[:id] is the string "1", but find is smart enough to convert this to an integer.
  	#Note that the debug information in Figure 7.6 confirms the value of params[:id]: 1 
  	#This is why the code below finds the user with id 1.
